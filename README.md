# Hotel Reservation Cancellation Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting hotel reservation cancellations using machine learning algorithms. The dataset contains information about hotel bookings, including booking details, guest demographics, and booking channels. We applied exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and various machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and a stacking technique for ensemble learning. Additionally, thorough data cleaning procedures were employed to enhance model performance.

# Methodology
### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of features, identify patterns, and uncover potential correlations.
Visualized key relationships between variables using plots such as histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices.
### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Performed extensive data cleaning procedures to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data.
Preprocessed categorical variables through encoding techniques such as one-hot encoding and label encoding.
Standardized numerical features to ensure uniformity across the dataset.
### 3. Machine Learning Algorithms
Implemented multiple machine learning algorithms, including SVM, kNN, and a stacking ensemble technique.
Tuned hyperparameters for each algorithm using techniques such as grid search or random search.
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Results
Achieved promising results in predicting hotel reservation cancellations using SVM, kNN, and the stacking ensemble technique.
Identified significant features contributing to cancellation prediction through feature importance analysis.
Compared the performance of individual algorithms and the stacking ensemble method to determine the most effective approach.

# Conclusion
This project showcases the application of exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and machine learning techniques to predict hotel reservation cancellations. By accurately predicting cancellations, hotels can optimize their operations, manage inventory effectively, and enhance overall revenue management strategies.
